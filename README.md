*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by msimoes*

## Description
The Libft project is the first project of the 42 curriculum. It is an introduction to the basics of the programming language. This project's objective is to create our own C library by recreating existing C functions.

The goal of this project is to create a library of functions that will be used throughout the entire curriculum.

## Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the project, simply run:
```bash
make
```

To recompile everything, run:
```bash
make re
```

This will create a library called `libft.a` that then can be used on each individual project.

### Cleanup
Remove object files:
```bash
make clean
```

Remove object files and the library:
```bash
make fclean
```
